# Gender & Age Detection using Deep Learning 

This project uses **TensorFlow**, **Keras**, and **MobileNetV2** to detect the **gender** and estimate the **age** of individuals from facial images. It demonstrates how pre-trained models can be fine-tuned for classification and regression tasks on facial datasets.

##  Features
- Gender classification (Male/Female)
- Age estimation (regression)
- Based on MobileNetV2 (lightweight CNN)
- Image preprocessing with OpenCV
- Real-time or static image prediction
- Visualization with bounding boxes and labels

##  Dataset
Uses a dataset of labeled facial images with gender and age annotations. (Dataset not included due to size/privacy. You may use UTKFace or a custom set.)

## ðŸ›  Technologies
- Python 3
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- MobileNetV2 (Transfer Learning)
- Matplotlib, Pandas, NumPy
